# 100DaysOfPython
I am going to use this README as a way to log what I have been doing every day of the 100 Days Of Python Challenge I am doing.

I have done a few 100DaysOfCode challenges in the past, and have done a 365DaysOfCode challenge as well. I have always found that these challenges really help me learn something new, so I am taking advantage of this one to learn Python a little better.

You can view me tweeting my progress over at my [X profile (Twitter)](https://twitter.com/russintech).

## Day 1 (8/5/23)
- [Sudoku Solver](https://github.com/rperry99/Sudoku-Solver-Python)
    - I followed a video tutorial on it. I needed a refresher of how python worked, and it's syntax, so I chose a project that was on youtube to follow along to.

## Day 2 (8/6/23)
- [Python Calculator](https://github.com/rperry99/Python-Calculator)
    - Started a small project to do something on my own for Python.
    - Just a simple calculator where you enter a string like "55 - 10", and it will spit out the answer in a real sentence like "The answer to 55 - 10 is 45".

## Day 3 (8/7/23)
- [Python Calculator](https://github.com/rperry99/Python-Calculator)
    - Continued working on the python calculator. Refactored the code so functions were better broken down. Also added the ability to use floats (decimal numbers).
    - If the answer is a whole number, the program will also trim off the .0 since the number is a float.
    - I am aware this isn't going to be a super accurate calculator, just doing the project for some practice.

    - 1 7kyu challenge
    - 1 6kyu challenge

## Day 4 (8/8/23)
- [Coding Kata](https://www.codewars.com/users/russintech)
    - 2 7kyu challenges
    - 2 6kyu challenges
- Checked out [Exercism](https://exercism.org/) as a way to practice. I kind of liked it, but I found the challenges difficult in the fact I didn't know what they were asking me. I got stuck on one of the first Python ones about money exchange. Not that I didn't know what to do, I didn't know what it was asking. I think the question had too little information.

## Day 5 (8/9/23)
- Started a new project, [Python Horror Picker](https://github.com/rperry99/Python-Horror-Picker)
    - My idea is an app that will give you a random horror movie from a list. I have more ideas I want to implement, like being able to select sub-genres, or maybe even vibes of the movie. I would like to try looking into integrating Pandas into it for some database stuff.

## Day 6 (8/10/23)
- Added some functionality to [Python Horror Picker](https://github.com/rperry99/Python-Horror-Picker).
    - Now there's an array of arrays. Each movie has a sub-genre attached. In the future, I am going to allow the user to enter a subgenre, and a random movie in that subgenre will be picked.

## Day 7 (8/11/23)
- Added some functionality to [Python Horror Picker](https://github.com/rperry99/Python-Horror-Picker).
    - The user can now enter the subgenre they want for the movie.
    - The program will shuffle the array, then loop though it, picking the first movie that matches the subgenre chosen by the user.
    - If there isn't a movie in the subgenre in the list, then the user will be told as much.

## Day 8 (8/12/23)
- All I did today was some code katas. I feel like algorithms are a weak point for me anyway.
    - 2 6kyu Kata

# 100DaysOfPython
I am going to use this README as a way to log what I have been doing every day of the 100 Days Of Python Challenge I am doing.

I have done a few 100DaysOfCode challenges in the past, and have done a 365DaysOfCode challenge as well. I have always found that these challenges really help me learn something new, so I am taking advantage of this one to learn Python a little better.

You can view me tweeting my progress over at my (X profile (Twitter))[https://twitter.com/russintech].

### Day 1 (8/5/23)
- (Sudoku Solver)[https://github.com/rperry99/Sudoku-Solver-Python]
    - I followed a video tutorial on it. I needed a refresher of how python worked, and it's syntax, so I chose a project that was on youtube to follow along to.

### Day 2 (8/6/23)
- (Python Calculator)[https://github.com/rperry99/Python-Calculator]
    - Started a small project to do something on my own for Python.
    - Just a simple calculator where you enter a string like "55 - 10", and it will spit out the answer in a real sentence like "The answer to 55 - 10 is 45".
